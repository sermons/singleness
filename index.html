>>>
+ both the **woefully** single
  + **wanting** to get married
+ and the **happily** single
  + today's passage is for you, too
+ underlying principles apply to **all** of us
  + **married**, seniors, teens
  + e.g., widowed pastor's wife
+ don't **chase** after bf/gf, marriage, grades, career
  + these will **disappoint**
+ chase after God w/ **undivided heart**

Now about **virgins**:

I have **no command** from the Lord, <br/>
but I give a **judgment** as one <br/>
who by the Lord’s mercy is **trustworthy**.

[1 Corinthians 7:25 (NIV) (p.1/8)](# "ref")

******
[26](# "ref")
Because of the **present crisis**, <br>
I think that it is good for a man <br>
to **remain** as he is.

[27](# "ref")
Are you **pledged** to a woman? <br/>
Do not seek to be **released**.

Are you **free** from such a commitment? <br/>
Do not **look** for a wife.

[1 Corinthians 7:26-27 (NIV) (p.2/8)](# "ref")

******
[28](# "ref")
But if you do **marry**, you have **not sinned**; <br/>
and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned.

But those who marry  <br/>
will face **many troubles** in this life, <br/>
and I want to **spare** you this.

[1 Corinthians 7:28 (NIV) (p.3/8)](# "ref")

******
[29](# "ref")
What I mean, brothers and sisters, <br/>
is that the **time is short**.

From now on those who **have** wives <br/>
should live as if they **do not**;

[30](# "ref")
those who **mourn**, as if they did not; <br/>
those who are **happy**, as if they were not;

[1 Corinthians 7:29-30 (NIV) (p.4/8)](# "ref")

******
those who **buy** something, <br/>
as if it were not theirs to **keep**;

[31](# "ref")
those who **use** the things of the world, <br/>
as if not **engrossed** in them.

For this **world** in its present form <br>
is **passing away**.

[1 Corinthians 7:30-31 (NIV) (p.5/8)](# "ref")

******
[32](# "ref")
I would like you to be **free from concern**.

An **unmarried man** is concerned about <br/>
the **Lord’s** affairs — <br>
how he can **please** the Lord.

[33](# "ref")
But a **married man** <br/>
is concerned about the **affairs of this world** — <br/>
how he can please his **wife** — <br/>
[34](# "ref")
and his interests are **divided**.

[1 Corinthians 7:32-34 (NIV) (p.6/8)](# "ref")

******
An **unmarried woman** or virgin <br/>
is concerned about the **Lord’s affairs**: <br/>
Her aim is to be **devoted** to the Lord <br/>
in both **body** and **spirit**.

But a **married woman** <br/>
is concerned about the **affairs of this world** — <br/>
how she can please her **husband**.

[1 Corinthians 7:34 (NIV) (p.7/8)](# "ref")

******

I am saying this for your **own good**, <br/>
