# What does the Bible say to **singles**?

>>>
+ youth: want to "level up" to next stage of life
  + college, work, marriage, children, ...
+ devote yourself to God in the *now*, not the *someday*
	+ don't chase after bf/gf, marriage, grades, career: these will disappoint
	+ chase after God with an **undivided heart**

<span class="ref">25</span>
Now about **virgins**:

I have **no command** from the Lord, <br/>
but I give a **judgment** as one <br/>
who by the Lord’s mercy is **trustworthy**.

---
<span class="ref">26</span>
Because of the **present crisis**, <br/>
I think that it is good for a man to **remain** as he is.

<span class="ref">27</span>
Are you **pledged** to a woman? <br/>
Do not seek to be **released**.

Are you **free** from such a commitment? <br/>
Do not **look** for a wife.

---
<span class="ref">28</span>
But if you do **marry**, you have **not sinned**; <br/>
and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned.

But those who marry  <br/>
will face **many troubles** in this life, <br/>
and I want to **spare** you this.

---
<span class="ref">29</span>
What I mean, brothers and sisters, <br/>
is that the **time is short**.

From now on those who **have** wives <br/>
should live as if they **do not**;

<span class="ref">30</span>
those who **mourn**, as if they did not; <br/>
those who are **happy**, as if they were not;

---
those who **buy** something, <br/>
as if it were not theirs to **keep**;

<span class="ref">31</span>
those who **use** the things of the world, <br/>
as if not **engrossed** in them.

For this **world** in its present form is **passing away**.

---
<span class="ref">32</span>
I would like you to be **free from concern**.

An **unmarried man** is concerned about <br/>
the **Lord’s affairs** — how he can please the Lord.

<span class="ref">33</span>
But a **married man** <br/>
is concerned about the **affairs of this world** — <br/>
how he can please his **wife** — <br/>
<span class="ref">34</span>
and his interests are **divided**.

---
An **unmarried woman** or virgin <br/>
is concerned about the **Lord’s affairs**: <br/>
Her aim is to be **devoted** to the Lord <br/>
in both **body** and **spirit**.

But a **married woman** <br/>
is concerned about the **affairs of this world** — <br/>
how she can please her **husband**.

---
<span class="ref">35</span>
I am saying this for your **own good**, <br/>
not to **restrict** you, <br/>
but that you may live in a **right** way <br/>
in **undivided devotion** to the Lord.
